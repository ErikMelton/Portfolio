Hi! I'm **Erik Melton**, a **full stack** and **mobile developer** living in **Oslo, Norway** and **Folsom, California**.

I currently work at [AUKA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikmelton/), helping the app team deliver responsive and highly scalable systems and React Native apps by using cutting edge technologies.

I love creating and contributing to [Open Source Software](https://github.com/erikmelton). I also run my own tech blog at [blog.erikmelton.me](https://blog.erikmelton.me), where I post about the technologies I work with and experiment with.
